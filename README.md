# CipherChat-testing
Try to get more control over the tor process (only a test project)

-> Will be integrated into CipherChat after completion

**Using:**
- Bridge Ips: https://github.com/scriptzteam/Tor-Bridges-Collector
- Proxy Ips: https://github.com/zloi-user/hideip.me

## To do list
- [x] GPG keys must be requested via proxy
- [x] Encrypted persistent storage key can be stored in .conf file instead of the hash and used to verify the password
- [ ] Hidden services used must still be stored (encrypted)
- [ ] When requesting the persistent storage password to create the conf file, you must be asked whether user data including passwords should also be saved
-> When all the To Do`s above have been completed, this repository becomes the main repository at https://github.com/tn3w/CipherChat
